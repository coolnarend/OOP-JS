                        <h2>1. Inheritance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming 
                            that enables an object to take on the properties and methods of
                            another object. And this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application.
                        </p> 
                        <p><strong>Here is an example.</strong> <br>
                            So we have this circle class with one method, computeOptimumLocation. 
                            Let's imagine tomorrow we're going to add another class to our application called square. 
                            And square also needs this method, computeOptimumLocation. <br>
                            For now let's imagine the implementation of this object is exactly the same
                            across these two different classes, you don't want to repeat this implementation. <br>
                            Because if there is a bug in this application, you have to fix it
                            in multiple places. Or if we decide to change the implementation
                            better, again, you have to repeat this in different places. <br> 
                            <img src="./img/inheritance-1.JPG" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"> <br>
                            So that's when inheritance comes to the rescue.
                            We can define a new class called Shape, put this method there, and
                            have circle and square inherit this method, of the shape of the class. <br>
                            <img src="./img/inheritance-2.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            Now in inheritance, we have a few terms that you should be familiar with,
                            because I'm going to use these terms throughout this course. In this diagram, 
                            we refer to the shape class as the base class, or super class, or parent class. 
                            All these terms are exactly the same. Different tutorials and different books use 
                            different terms. In contrast, we refer to the circle as the direct class
                            or sub class, or child class, and finally, we refer to the inheritance relationship 
                            as IS-A relationship. So, we say circle IS-A shape.
                            Now this is the classical definition of inheritance.

                        <h2>2. Prototypes and Prototypical Inheritance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Well, here we have a circle object. We can define another object
                            let's call it shape, and add all the common behavior, or all the common methods 
                            in this object, like computeOptimumLocation. And then somehow we can link
                            a circle object to the shape object. Now we refer to the shape object
                            as the prototype of the circle.
                            <strong>So a prototype is essentially a parent of another object.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whenever you hear the word prototype, just think parent. 
                            So every object in JavaScript, except only a single object (i.e. root object), has a prototype
                            for parent. And it inherits all the members we find in it's prototype.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/proto-1.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            I'm going to define a new object, just an empty object. Now let's
                            inspect this. So, look here we have a property called proto. Note that this property
                            is faded, because it's deprecated, and you shouldn't directly access it.
                            It's only available here to help you troubleshoot problems. So let's 
                            expand this, alright look, this is the prototype, or parent, for this x object that 
                            we created here. We have these properties and methods, like constructor, you saw that in the last 
                            section. So every object has a constructor property which references the function that was used to construct or create
                            that object. We also have that object here toString so, let's use that method, you can type x.toString. <br>
                            <img src="./img/proto-2.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                        </p>
                        <p> So every object that we create in JavaScript directly or indirectly inherits from prototype of its parent object and this parent object doesn't have a prototype or parent object.</p>
                        <p>
                            <img src="./img/proto-3.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            We have x and y, and both these objects reference object base.
                            So we have a single instance of objectBase in memory. <br>
                            <img src="./img/proto-4.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            Both, x and y have the exact same prototype. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So now that you understand what a prototype is, let's define <strong>prototypical inheritance</strong>. <br>
                            <img src="./img/proto-5.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            Earlier, we accessed the toString (i.e.: x.toString()) method, on the x object, we didn't define 
                            method in our x object, because x was an empty object, right?
                            So how does this work, how can we access this method? Well, when we access a property or a method on an object, 
                            JavaScript engine first looks for that property or method first on the object itself (i.e. <strong>x object</strong> ).
                            If it can't find it, then it looks at the prototype for that object.
                            Again, if it can find that member, it will look at the prototype of that object 
                            all the way up to the <strong>root object</strong> which we call objectBase. So this is <strong>prototypical inheritance</strong> in action.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, once again, I want to emphasize that a prototype is just a regular object in memory. <br>
                            <img src="./img/proto-6.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            There is nothing special about it. Every object has a prototype or a parent, except the root object.
                        </p>
