                        <p>JavaScript is all about objects, so in order to learn object-oriented programming, first you need to have
                            a good understanding of objects. So in this section, I'm going to cover some fundamental concepts are objects, such as 
                            <strong> creating objects, factories and constructors, primitives and reference types, and how they behave differently, working with the properties of an object such as
                                adding, removing properties, as well as enumerating them. We're also going to learn how to define private properties as well as getters
                                and setters.
                            </strong>
