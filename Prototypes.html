                        <h2>1. Inheritance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming 
                            that enables an object to take on the properties and methods of
                            another object. And this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application.
                        </p> 
                        <p><strong>Here is an example.</strong> <br>
                            So we have this circle class with one method, computeOptimumLocation. 
                            Let's imagine tomorrow we're going to add another class to our application called square. 
                            And square also needs this method, computeOptimumLocation. <br>
                            For now let's imagine the implementation of this object is exactly the same
                            across these two different classes, you don't want to repeat this implementation. <br>
                            Because if there is a bug in this application, you have to fix it
                            in multiple places. Or if we decide to change the implementation
                            better, again, you have to repeat this in different places. <br> 
                            <img src="./img/inheritance-1.JPG" alt="" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive"> <br>
                            So that's when inheritance comes to the rescue.
                            We can define a new class called Shape, put this method there, and
                            have circle and square inherit this method, of the shape of the class. <br>
                            <img src="./img/inheritance-2.JPG" class="img-thumbnail img-responsive" alt=""> <br>
                            Now in inheritance, we have a few terms that you should be familiar with,
                            because I'm going to use these terms throughout this course. In this diagram, 
                            we refer to the shape class as the base class, or super class, or parent class. 
                            All these terms are exactly the same. Different tutorials and different books use 
                            different terms. In contrast, we refer to the circle as the direct class
                            or sub class, or child class, and finally, we refer to the inheritance relationship 
                            as IS-A relationship. So, we say circle IS-A shape.
                            Now this is the classical definition of inheritance.
