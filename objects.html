                        <h1>Objects</h1>
                        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                        <p>JavaScript is all about objects, so in order to learn object-oriented programming, first you need to have
                            a good understanding of objects. So in this section, I'm going to cover some fundamental concepts are objects, such as 
                            <strong> creating objects, factories and constructors, primitives and reference types, and how they behave differently, working with the properties of an object such as
                                adding, removing properties, as well as enumerating them. We're also going to learn how to define private properties as well as getters
                                and setters.
                            </strong>
                        </p>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>2. Object Literals</h2>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Using object literal syntax. So these curly braces {}, we refer to them as object literal syntax.</li>
                                <li>An object in JavaScript is essentially a collection of key value pairs. So inside these curly braces I'm going to add a few key value pairs</li>
                                <li>
                                    Example:
                                    <br>
        <pre>
            <code>
                const circle = {
                    radius: 1,
                    location: {
                        x: 1,
                        y: 1
                    },
                    draw: function() {
                        console.log('draw');
                    }
                };
                circle.draw();
                // outputs: draw
            </code>
        </pre>
                                </li>
                                <!-- <script>

                                    const circle = {
                                        radius: 1,
                                        location: {
                                            x: 1,
                                            y: 1
                                        },
                                        draw: function() {
                                            console.log('draw');
                                        }
                                    };
                                    circle.draw();
                                </script> -->
                        </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>3. Factories</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Now let's imagine here we didn't have this draw method. Duplicating this object wouldn't be a big deal, so basically we would end up with two objects, and then here we could use
                                different values. So creating objects with the object literal syntax is an issue only if that object has a behavior. So what's the solution? The solution is to use a factory or a constructor function.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Example:</strong>
                                <p>So let me show you how that works. I'm going to delete, this second circle, and define a function called createCircle.
                                    Now, I'm going to move all this code inside this new function like this. Now we don't need to declare a constant, we can simple return this object.
                                    Now this circle requires a radius so instead of hard coding one here, I'm going to add a parameter, radius, and then set that here.
                                    Now in ES6 we have this new feature, so if the key and the value are the same we can remove the noise in the code by removing the value, so we can only add radius. Now, to
                                    simplify the code so you can focus on what I'm going to teach you, I'm going to drop this location property, you don't really need it.
                                    Instead I'm going to add our draw method. So key value, and let's do a simple console.log draw, okay?
                                    So this is what we call a factory function. Now, you can simply call this function to create a new circle so constant, circle, we call createCircle and pass 1 as the radius.
                                </p>
                            </li>
<pre>
    <code>
        // Factory function
        function createCircle(radius){
            return {
                radius,
                draw: function() {
                    console.log('draw with radius '+ radius);
                }
            }
        }
        const circle = createCircle(1);
        circle.draw();
        //outouts: draw with radius 1
        const circle2 = createCircle(2);
        circle2.draw();
        //outouts: draw with radius 2
    </code>
</pre>
                               

                            </script>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>4. Constructors</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Now there is another way to create an object using a constructor function.</li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Example: </strong><br>
<pre>
    <code>
        function Circle(radius) {
            console.log('this', this)
            this.radius = radius;
            this.draw = function() {
                console.log('draw with radius: ' + radius);
            };
        }
        const another = new Circle(1);
        another.draw();
        /*
            outputs in console:
            - this Circle {}
            - draw with radius: 1
        */
    </code>
</pre>    
                            </li>
                            <li>So, our circle function is, going to take a radius parameter, but in the body instead of returning an object we're going to use
                                the <strong>this</strong> keyword to set the properties of this object.
                                What is <strong>this</strong>. This is basically a reference to the object that is executing this piece of code. 
                                We're going to see that in a second. So, imagine we have a new empty object in memory now we're going to use this to reference that object and 
                                then use .notation to set various properties on that object. So we can set the radius property to this radius argument. Similarly,
                                we can define another property, draw, but this is more accurately a method, so we set it to a function, and here we go to a console.log of draw.
                                Okay? Now, we can create a new circle, like this. We use the new operator to call the Circle function and pass 1 as the argument.
                                When we use the new operator, a few things happen under the hood.
                                This new operator will create an empty object so like this. An empty object. Then, it will set this to point to that object.
                                Because by default, this points to the global object. If you're running this code inside of a browser, the global
                                object is the window object. If you're running it inside a node environment, the global object is global.
                            </li>
                            <li>So, when we use the new operator to call a function, 3 things happen. First, this new operator will create an empty object.
                                Then, it will set this to point to that object and finally, it will return that object from this function, so note that here we don't have
                                an explicit return statement, you're not retuning this. This will happen automatically when we use the new operator.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h2>5. Constructor Property</h2>
                        <p>Every object in JavaScript has a property called constructor, and that references the function that was used to construct
                            or create an object. So here we have two objects.</p>
                        <p>
<pre><code>
    function Circle(radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
        this.draw = function() {
            console.log('draw with radius: ' + radius);
        };
    }
    const another = new Circle(1);
    
    console.log(another.constructor);

                        <h2>6. Functions are Objects</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One of the confusing concepts in JavaScript is here, functions are objects. So this circle function we have here is actually an object.
                                Don't believe me, let me show you, so circle, look these are all the members of the circle function or circle object.
                                <br>

                        <h2>7. Values vs Reference Types</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                    In JavaScript we have two categories of types. On one side we have value types, also called <strong>primitives or value types</strong>, on the other side we have <strong>reference types</strong>.
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="./img/types.JPG" alt="Values vs Reference Types" title="Values vs Reference Types" />
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                    I'm going to define two primitives, x and y. I'm going to set y to x, so here y is 10, now I'm going to change the value of x to 20, what I want you to note here,
                                    is that x and y are two independent variables, so, let's save the changes, go back in the console, let's log x, x is 20, and y
                                    is 10, they are independent. 
                                    <br>
                                    <img src="./img/types-2.JPG" alt="Values vs Reference Types" title="Values vs Reference Types" />
                                    <br>
                                    So when we work with primitives. This value, this value that we have here is
                                    stored inside of this variable. When we copy that variable that value that is stored in the variable is
                                    copied into this new variable. So they are completely independent of each other.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Now let's see what happens if we use a reference type or an object here. So I'm going to
                                change this to an object that has a property called value. And then instead of saying x to 20, I'm going to set x.value to 20.
                                <br>
                                <img src="./img/types-3.JPG" alt="Values vs Reference Types" title="Values vs Reference Types" />
                                <br>
                                So save the changes, back in the console, let's log x so you can see value property is 20,
                                now let's log y, you can see the value property of y is also 20. So this is the takeaway. When we use
                                an object, that object is not stored in this variable.
                                That object is stored somewhere else in the memory, and the address of that memory location is stored inside that memory variable.
                                So then when we copy x into y, it's the address or the reference that is copied. In other words, both x and y are pointing to the same,
                                object in memory. And when we modify each object using x, or y, our changes are immediately visible to other variable.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>So here's the conclusion. Primitives are copied by value, reference types or objects are copied by by their reference.</strong>

                                So remember this, in JavaScript we have value types, also called primitives, as well as
                                reference types which are objects. Our primitives are number, string, boolean, undefined and
                                null. Primitives or value types are copied by their value reference types or objects, are copied by their reference.

                                Now these objects in JavaScript are dynamic. That means, after you create them we can add extra properties in them 
                                and delete some properties. You may be wondering why this is useful in the real world. Imagine you're working with the 
                                user object. The client, it can be a web or mobile application is going to send a user object to the server
                                on the server, we get this user object, and then we add additional stuff to it. For example we can add a token property
                                that we generate on the fly on the server. So we can always add something extra to an existing object.
                                Because we don't have classes, we don't need to define these properties ahead of time.
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                We can add them whenever we need them, and that makes JavaScript extremely powerful and easy to work with. In languages like C#
                                or Java, every time we want to implement scenarios like this we have to go back and change our classes. So here, let me go 
                                back and add a property to our circle object. You can set the location here, like this. Save the changes,
                                now here on the console, let's log circle alright you can see here we have two properties location and radius. You also have another
                                notation for accessing properties, that is bracket notation. So, another way to rewrite this code is like this.
                                We use brackets and use a string to reference a property. So location. It's exactly the same. As you can see, the dot notation
                                is simpler, and less verbose then brackett notation, but this notation is also useful in certain scenarios.
                                For example, when you want to dynamically access a property name. For example, let's imagine we have this
                                constant called propertyName set to location. We have that somewhere in our application,
                                now we want to access the location property of a circle. If you're dealing with this dynamically at a time
                                of writing the code, we don't know what is the name of that property. That is calculated at run time. So we can type something like this, 
                                circle.location. But what we can do is use the bracket notation. So we use circle brackets, property, name.
                                Another use case for using the bracket notation, is when you are using the property names that are not valid identifiers.
                                For example, let's imagine that the name of this property is center-location.
                                We can't access this property like this. Circle-center-location, that doesn't work, so if you have special characters
                                or a space, that's when you use the bracket notation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Now we can also delete a property from an existing object. A real world use case for this
                                is when you get a user object from a database, and you want to return it to the client.
                                But maybe that user object has certain properties you don't want to send to the client. 
                                You don't want to send the password, you don't want to send the credit card info, in that case, you will dynamically delete
                                one or more properties from an object. So, we use the delete operator, and then reference the property name. So,
                                circle.location. Again, here we can use the .notation or brackets.

                        <h2>9. Enumerating Properties</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Sometimes you need to iterate over, or enumerate properties in an object. We can do that using the for in loop. So,
                                for let key in circle. So in every iteration, key will hold the value of one key in this object.
                                Let's log that on the console. Okay, So look we have radius, and draw so it's returning both properties and methods.
                                Now if you want to get the value of these properties you can use the bracket notation.
                                So here, in console.log I'm going to log. circle of key. We learned in the last
                                lecture that we can use the bracket notation to access a member.
                                Okay? So save, now we can see we use 10 and draw as a function. What if we want to get only the properties and not the methods? Well,
                                we can use the type of operator to check the type of this value. So, if typeof circle of key. Is not equal to function
                                then we will display it on the console. Save. Get the changes, now we get only the radius. There is
                                another approach to get all the keys in an object, so, this object that we have as a method called keys, we can pass our circle object here
                                and this will return all the keys in the circle as an array. So, let's store them here, and log them on the console.
                                So, here we have an array with two members, radius and draw. With this approach, we cannot separate the properties from methods. Now finally, sometimes you want to know
                                if an object has a given property. For that we use the in operator. So, if here we add the name of the property on the string, if radius
                                is in circle, we do a console.log of circle as a radius. Okay? Save the changes, and here's our message.

                        <p><strong>Abstraction means we should hide the details and complexity and show or expose only the essentials.</strong></p>
                        <p>Example:</p>                   
<pre>
    <code>
    function Circle(radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
        this.defaultLocation = {x: 0, y: 0};
        this.computeOptimumLocation = function() {
            // ...
            console.log('computeOptimumLocation - function called');
        }
        this.draw = function() {
            this.computeOptimumLocation();
            console.log('draw');
        }
    }

    const circle = new Circle(10);
    circle.computeOptimumLocation();
    circle.draw();
    </code>
</pre>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this particular example, we should hide this property "defaultLocation" as well as this "computeOptimumLocation" method.</li>
                            <li>These are implementation details, these are part of the complexity of this object, we want to hide these from the consumers of this object.</li>
                            <li>Instead, we want to expose only the essentials, that is the radius and the draw method.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A lot of developers who have not been able to apply object oriented programming effectively have failed to comply with this principle.
                            Everything in their objects, is public and accessible from the outside.</p>
                        <p>And this will bring a number of issues. One issue is that every time we change the implementation of that object, you have to modify many different places in your code. </p>
