1. What is OOP?
- A programming paradigm centered around objests rather than functions.
- Trans: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm or style of programming that is centered around objects rather than functions. It's nothing new, it's been around since the 70's, but unlike tools and frameworks that come and go, object-oriented programming is still very relevant today, that's because it's not a programming language or tool. It's a style of programming or a programming paradigm. There are several programming languages out there that support object oriented programming, such as C#, Java, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and more. Now JavaScript is a little bit controversial, but I will get to that later. It may interest you to know that many of the popular frameworks out there that you may know or be using are actually designed with object oriented programming concepts in mind. Angular is an example of these frameworks. So, object-oriented programming is a very popular style of programming, and it comes up in many technical interviews. 

2. 4 Pillars of OOP
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- So in object-oriented programming you group related variables, and functions that operate on them into objects. And this is what we call encapsulation. 
- So one of the symptoms of procedural code is functions with so many parameters. When you write code in an object oriented way, your functions end up having fewer and fewer parameters. As Uncle Bob says, the best functions are those with no parameters. The fewer the number of parameters, the easier it is to use and maintain that function. So that's encapsulation.
